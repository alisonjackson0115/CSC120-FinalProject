Viral Influencer: Cheat Sheet
Gameplay: Complete five risk-filled photo assignments in the midst of an apocalypse to be able to flee to safety

Are you ready?
yes
Ok, let’s set the scene. Welcome to Viral Influencer, a game where you are one of the only survivors after a mysterious illness wipes out your entire city. In order to leave the city, you must travel to different destinations, collecting supplies points by taking photos. Right now, you are at home. Would you like to receive your first photo quest?
no
Please type ‘yes’ to continue the game. 
yes
Your first photo quest is the City Greenhouse, which is known for its beautiful sunrises. The greenhouse has a risk level of 1 because it is not known for inviting danger, but proceed with caution. To earn your supplies point, enter the greenhouse and take a photo. Do you accept the challenge?
yes
To move throughout the city and find the City Greenhouse, type in one of the following directions:
up
down

You are at the City Hospital. Please try a different direction.

You are at the City Mall. Please try a different direction. 
up
This direction is beyond city limits. Please try a different direction.
right
You are at the City Hall. Please try a different direction.
down
You are Home. Please try a different direction. 
right

You are at the City Greenhouse! Would you like to enter?
yes
You are now inside the Greenhouse. You wander around until you find the pond—the location of your photo quest. Would you like to take your first photo?
yes
Click! Your photo was taken. You have 1 supplies point.
Ready for your next photo quest?
yes

Your second photo quest is at the top of the City’s tallest Skyscraper, which is 50 stories tall! This quest has a risk level of 2 because of the dimly lit, unreliable elevator. However, 50 flights of stairs will quickly drain your energy, which is important to keep up during your quests. Do you accept the challenge?
yes
Enter a direction to move throughout the city. Remember you are currently at the City Greenhouse. 
up
down

right
up
You made it to the skyscraper! How will you get to the roof? Type in “stairs” or “elevator” to choose your route. 
stairs
Unfortunately, you don’t have enough energy to climb 50 flights of stairs. Please try a different route. 
elevator
You’re in luck! The elevator is running for the first time in weeks and it looks like you’re all alone in the City Skyscraper. Now that you’ve made it to the top floor, would you like to take your picture?
yes
You have 2 supplies points. Enter ‘yes’ to receive your third quest.
yes
Your third photo quest is the City Hall, with a risk level of 3. The infrastructure is decaying and potentially dangerous survivors may be looming, so enter at your own risk. Do you accept the challenge?
yes
Enter a direction to move throughout the city. Remember you are currently at the City Skyscraper.

You have made it to the City Hall. Which entrance would you like to go through? A group of other survivors is known to hang around the front entrance, but the back entrance has some rickety stairs. Enter ‘front’ or ‘back’ to make your choice. 
back
Oh, no! The stairs have fallen apart and there’s no way for you to enter through the back. Please try a different route. 
front
Phew, the survivors are not around today so the coast is clear!
You have 3 supplies points. 
Would you like to receive your fourth quest?
yes
Your fourth quest is in the City’s abandoned shopping mall. Given the amount of shelter it provides, the mall is almost always occupied by other survivors and its risk level is 4. Sometimes they are harmless and will let you go about your business, but it’s not uncommon for a group of survivors to try and steal your supplies. You need to approach with caution and use your intuition to navigate this quest. Are you ready to head over to the City Mall?
yes
Enter a direction to move throughout the city. Remember you are currently at the City Hall. 
up

You made it to the mall! You can already see a group of survivors milling around outside the mall’s entrance. Do you take your chances and try to interact with them, or will you head for the other entrance? Enter ‘interact’ or ‘avoid’ to make your decision. 
avoid
It’s generally good to be cautious of survivors, but you have no idea how to find the location for your photo. It might be worth talking to them after all. Please try a different route. 
approach
What are the odds that one of those survivors was your elementary school teacher? They informed the rest of their group that you can be trusted, and they gave you advice for how to complete your quest without getting caught by other groups. You head to your photo location and find the perfect shot. Are you ready to take your photo?
yes
Great job, your fourth task is complete and you’re one step closer to leaving the city! You only need one more supplies point, but this quest is the most dangerous. Are you up for the challenge?
yes
Very brave! Your fifth and final photo assignment is in the abandoned City Hospital and quarantine zone. For this quest, it’s not the survivors you have to worry about—it’s the Fever. This location still harbors contagious Fever particles and one misstep can cost you all of your supplies points, which gives this quest a risk level of 5. However, completing this task means you can leave the city and find the safety you’ve been seeking for so long. Would you like to head to the City Hospital and try your hand at this challenge?
yes
Enter a direction to move throughout the city. Remember you are currently at the City Mall.

You’ve arrived at the City Hospital. For your first decision, you must choose between entering through the hospital entrance or the quarantine entrance. To select your path, enter ‘hospital’ or ‘quarantine.’
quarantine
Woah, that was a close one! As you started to enter the quarantine zone, you noticed a cart of uncapped samples and had second thoughts. Please try a different route. 
hospital
This was the safer choice! But your quest is far from complete. Will you put on one of the hazmat suits you see laying around? This suit might keep you safe from exposure, or it could be infected with the Fever. To choose whether or not you will put on the suit, enter ‘yes’ or ‘no.’
no
I’m so sorry, but without the hazmat suit you had a dangerous exposure to the Fever and you are required to return your supplies points and enter quarantine. You must begin with the first quest to collect supplies points again. 
yes
That was risky, but it paid off! You can now travel to your photo destination without fear of exposure. Would you like to take your final photo?
yes
Congratulations, you have collected all of the supplies points needed to leave the city! The last thing you need to do is return home. Enter a direction to move throughout the city. Remember you are currently at the City Hospital.

You made it home! Before long, you have all of your belongings packed and you have enough supplies to last the entire trip to safety! Safe travels, and don’t forget to document your trip for the blog!
